# 🧠 Object Detection with YOLOv8 on Static Images

This project demonstrates object detection on a folder of static images using the **YOLOv8** model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). It processes each image and saves the results with bounding boxes and labels.

> ⚠️ Note: The detections are based on a pre-trained model (`yolov8n.pt`) and **may not always be 100% accurate**. This is intended as a demo for object recognition.

## 📌 Features

- Uses the lightweight **YOLOv8n** model for fast and efficient detection on low-spec machines (4GB RAM)
- Automatically detects common objects like: `person`, `car`, `bottle`, `laptop`, `dog`, `cat`, `book`, etc.
- Saves the result images in a separate folder for easy review and sharing.

## ✅ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
Place your input images in the images/ folder.

Run the script

bash
Copy code
python detect_images.py
Check the results/ folder for output images with detections.

🧠 What Can YOLOv8 Detect?
This model is trained on the COCO dataset and can detect over 80 objects, including:

People, Vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck, Bus)

Animals (Dog, Cat, Horse, Cow)

Electronics (TV, Laptop, Phone)

Kitchen items (Bottle, Cup, Fork, Spoon)

Food (Banana, Apple, Pizza)

Furniture (Chair, Sofa, Bed)

And many more...

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a demo project using a pre-trained model. While YOLOv8 performs very well, the predictions might not always be accurate depending on the image content or quality.
